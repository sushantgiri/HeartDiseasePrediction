# HeartDiseasePrediction
The repository is a part of a project of AI and ML Lab. The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset for analyzing the best accuracy and the model usage using maching learning algorithms. Futhermore, the project then utilitizes the best accurate model to predict the heart disease based on user input with interactive UI/UX experience.

# Data source
