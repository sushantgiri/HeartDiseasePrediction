# HeartDiseasePrediction
The repository is a part of a project of AI and ML Lab. The project utilizes the kaggle data source https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset as the part of its data set. The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset for analyzing the best accuracy and the model usage. Futhermore, the project then utilitizes the best accurate model to predict the heart disease based on user input with interactive UI/UX experience.
