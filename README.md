# HeartDiseasePrediction
The repository is a part of a project of AI and ML Lab. The project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset for analyzing the best accuracy and the model usage using maching learning algorithms. Futhermore, the project then utilitizes the best accurate model to predict the heart disease based on user input with interactive UI/UX experience.

# Data source
The project utilizes the kaggle data source https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset as the part of its data set.

# Libraries Used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- MatplotLib and Seaborn
- Yellow Brick
- Pickle
